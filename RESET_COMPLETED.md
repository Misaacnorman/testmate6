# Repository Reset Completed Successfully

## Summary
The main branch has been successfully reset to commit `414a9575a7de24662598c4d5fd77a5045d623dbd`, which is the commit immediately before the backend was moved to the root for Render compatibility.

## Changes Made
- Created a local `main` branch
- Performed a hard reset to commit `414a957`
- Verified that the repository structure is restored to the pre-move state

## Current State
- **Local main branch HEAD**: `414a9575a7de24662598c4d5fd77a5045d623dbd`
- **Backend files**: Now correctly located in `backend/` subdirectory
- **Frontend files**: Remain in `labfrontend/` subdirectory
- **Root directory**: Contains only top-level project files (package.json, README.md, etc.)

## Verification Commands
To verify the reset was successful, run:
```bash
git checkout main
git log --oneline -5
ls -la
ls -la backend/src/
```

## Next Steps
The local main branch has been reset correctly. To complete the process:

1. The main branch needs to be pushed to the remote repository
2. This will require force push permissions since we're rewriting history
3. The command would be: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`

⚠️ **Note**: Due to authentication limitations in this environment, the push to remote was not completed automatically. The repository owner will need to push the main branch manually or merge this reset into the main branch.

## What Was Undone
The following commit was effectively reverted:
- `c2b056e` - "refactor: move backend to project root for Render compatibility"

This restored the backend files from the root directory back to their original location in the `backend/` subdirectory.
